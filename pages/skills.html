    <h2>What I can do</h2>
    <div>
        <h3>Web Design</h3>
        <p>Based on briefs provided by the client, I create digital prototypes to match the client(s) vision. This is essential in ensuring the final product is in line with the clients wishes and desires. </p>

        </div>
        <p>Once I've created the digital prototypes as per the client's specifications, I embark on the major task which is creating the website from the initial design. Using HTML, CSS and (a bit of) JavaScript, I ensure that the site is developed as requested. As part of my routine work, I ensure the website is optimized for speed, performance, accessibility and search engine optimization(SEO).</p>

        <h3>WordPress</h3>
        
        <p>Who wouldn't want to easily manage all the content and multimedia on their website?
        When connecting the website to Wordpress, I pay special attention to the usability and intuitiveness of the interface
        being created. I use plugins that make it as easy as possible for the end user to administer the site.</p>
