                the major task which is creating the website from the initial design. Using HTML, CSS and (a bit of) JavaScript, I
                ensure that the site is developed as requested. As part of my routine work, I ensure the website is optimized for
                speed, performance, accessibility and search engine optimization(SEO).</p>
