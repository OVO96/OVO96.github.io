        <h1>A Brief Background...</h1>
        <p>After 3 months of self-teaching HTML and CSS fundamentals, I decided to challenge myself by doing real projects with
            real people. Projects are a good way to test your understanding of various programming concepts and I was like why
            not. As a beginner, imposter syndrome had taken the better part of me and I saw this as an opportunity to prove to
            myself that I knew what I was doing. I asked friends if they had any ideas they would have loved to bring to life in
            the form of websites and the response was amazing. The 3 slots I had offered for free, simple websites got filled
            pretty quick. I realized that now, I had responsibilities to various individuals and this made me up my game to
            deliver responsive, appealing websites. This is the first of the three.</p>

                <h1>The Challenges</h1>
                <p>1. Coming up with the website design</p>
                <p>2. Developing the website to the client's expectations</p>
                <p>Here's how I solved the above challenges:</p>
                <h2>Challenge #1: Website Design</h2>
                <p>With limited knowledge and experience in design, I embarked on a learning journey to familiarize myself with the
                    basics of design in order to build an aesthetically-pleasing interface with limited tools. This was in addition to
                    asking for assistance from the clients themselves on their color and interface preferences and from friends in
                    design who gave me invaluable information and resources that were instrumental in coming up with the final design I
                    came up with. I decided to settle on a minimalist design with neutral colors for the base and typography and a warm
                    accent.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="solutions solutions-footer">
                <h2>Challenge #2: Development Phase</h2>
                <p>The development phase proved more challenging than I had expected. It was a test of learned concepts and their
                    application to create a simple, accessible and responsive website. Throughout this phase, I had to revisit topics to
                    improve my understanding and integrate how everything works together to bring a presentable result. As my maiden
                    client project, I decided to work with pure HTML and CSS, no frameworks. I felt this would help cement what I had
                    learnt before I decide to venture into CSS frameworks and Javascript. As a beginner I experienced slight hiccups
                    with the following CSS properties: position, background, the box model and flexbox. However, I was able to overcome
                    the obstacles and come up with a website that satisfied the client. I plan to add new features as I continue
                    learning and getting better at frontend development.</p>
