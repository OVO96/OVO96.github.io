        <h1>A Brief Background...</h1>
        <p>After a few weeks of self-teaching HTML and CSS fundamentals, it was time to challenge myself by doing real projects with
            real people. They say you're not a developer till you roll out your first project and  projects also serve as a test of your understanding of various programming concepts and this proved a great time to try it out. As a beginner, imposter syndrome had taken the better part of me and I saw this as an opportunity to prove to
            myself that I knew my stuff. Therefore, I asked friends if they had any ideas they would have loved to bring to life in
            the form of websites and the response was amazing. I realized that, now, I had responsibilities to various individuals and this made me work hard to
            deliver responsive, appealing websites. This was one of the projects.</p>

                <h1>The Challenges</h1>
                <p>1. Coming up with the website design</p>
                <p>2. Developing the website to the client's expectations</p>
                <p>Here's how I solved the above challenges:</p>
                <h2>Challenge #1: Design Phase</h2>
                <p>This being a food website,the color choice was a very important part of the design process. You want the colors to be bright enough to catch the attention of the reader but not too bright to overwhelme the other details in the design. Therefore, I embarked on a learning journey to familiarize myself with the
                    basics of design in order to build an aesthetically-pleasing interface. This was in addition to
                    asking for assistance from the clients themselves on their color and interface preferences and from friends in
                    design who gave me invaluable information and resources that were instrumental in coming up with the final design. I decided to settle on a minimalist design with neutral colors for the base and typography and a warm
                    accent.</p>

                <h2>Challenge #2: Development Phase</h2>
                <p>The development phase proved more challenging than expected. It was a test of learned concepts and their
                    application to create a simple, accessible and responsive website. Throughout this phase, I had to revisit topics to
                    improve my understanding and integrate how everything works together to bring a presentable result. As my maiden
                    client project, I decided to work with pure HTML and CSS, no frameworks. This would help cement learnt concepts before deciding to venture into CSS frameworks and Javascript. As a beginner I experienced slight hiccups with various CSS properties. However, I was able to overcome
                    the obstacles and come up with a website that satisfied the client. I plan to add new features as I continue
                    learning and getting better at frontend development.</p>
